# Open Air Dance Socials: A Celebration of Dance Evolution

The free open air dance socials at Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich are not just an event; they're a testament to what dance schools have achieved. These gatherings started with the goal of teaching a few people to dance. Now, they bring joy to many, celebrating the art of dance. However, millions still remain unaware of what dance is and where to learn it. As times change, so must the customer acquisition and marketing strategies of dance schools.

### Innovative Marketing for Dance Schools

Dance schools should embrace guerrilla marketing techniques by organizing large open-air parties and flash mobs in bustling areas like Marienplatz and Odeonsplatz. Don’t wait for street festivals; Munich can be quiet on regular days. Imagine being the only event in the city, making people think, "The only thing to do in Munich is dancing. Everyone can dance, so where can I learn?" While organizing a party at Marienplatz isn't easy, dance businesses have the resources to make it happen. They can empower dance communities, influence city regulations, and become the voice of the dance community, advocating for our rights.

### Adapting to a New Dance Landscape

The era of the solo dance teacher in the city is over. With numerous dance schools and instructors now available, adapting to this new landscape is crucial. Working together with WeDance can help your business thrive. By supporting WeDance’s growth, you're also helping the dance community grow, which translates to more clients and more people eager to dance.

### Why WeDance is Essential for Your Dance Studio

Creating a website for your dance studio won't make a significant impact on its own. A small dance school in one city is just a tiny grain in the vast world. However, WeDance, as an international platform, aims to be the top result on Google for any dance-related keyword, even outranking Wikipedia for searches like "salsa" or "kizomba." We can only achieve this with your help. WeDance is not your competitor; it’s your best ally, providing a platform to showcase your strengths and creatively compete with other dance businesses.

### WeDance: The Ultimate Dance Platform

WeDance can effectively replace the need for your own website. Why is having a domain so important? It's about building trust. WeDance offers powerful tools to gain trust: transparent guest lists with photos, reviews, subscriber counts, view counts, and all the information a potential student needs to decide to attend your class.

Considering creating your own website? A template might cost €5 and a domain €15, but the true investment is far greater. A functional and effective website typically requires an investment of around €20,000. This budget covers:

- **Design**: Professional and user-friendly UI/UX design.
- **Development**: Skilled developers to ensure smooth functionality.
- **Content**: Quality content creation, including copywriting and media.
- **SEO**: Optimization to improve visibility and ranking.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing for usability and bugs.
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing updates and support.
