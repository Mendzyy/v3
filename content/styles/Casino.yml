history: The Cuban danzón of the 1890s was refashioned into the Cuban son of the 1920s by the incorporation of more Afro-Cuban dance elements—such as hip isolation, the tornillo (a man’s pivot on a single foot as he fully flexes the support leg)—and the discarding the descanso. The mambo was made popular by the Cuban musician Pérez Prado and developed in the 1940s as a marriage between son and swing. The cha-cha-chá replaced the mambo in the 1950s as a spin-off from the son characterized by the rhythmic pattern marked by the feet and counted “1, 2, 3, 4-and-1.” In the 1980s the son casino burst onto Havana dance floors and took over beach parking lots. Casino was faster in pace and was characterized by multiple turning figures. It is clearly related to New York salsa, though sources vary on which dance was a response to the other. Casino rueda developed from casino and placed couples in a circle; typically, the dance’s choreographies moved the women counterclockwise and the men clockwise as they switched partners.
