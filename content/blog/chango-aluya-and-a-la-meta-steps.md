**(I): Thank you for joining us today to discuss the intricate story and significance behind the Aluya and A La Metá steps. To begin, could you explain what these dance steps represent?**

**(D):** Of course. The Aluya and A La Metá steps are deeply rooted in Afro-Cuban religious traditions, particularly those involving Changó, one of the most revered Orishas in Yoruba culture. The "A La Metá" step, for instance, isn't just a dance move but a call—a sacred signal meant to summon Changó.

**I: That’s fascinating. So, how did these steps originate?**

**D:** The story goes back to the Yoruba traditions in Nigeria. Changó, who came from Oyo, was known as a charismatic and lively figure, famous for his celebrations. His father, the king of Oyo, sent him to Kosov to bring joy to the people, who were restless and hungry. However, instead of just throwing a party, Changó decided to steal bananas to feed them. This moment, represented in the A La Metá step, is about him gathering food and preparing a meal for the people of Kosov.

**I: You mentioned that the dance move of A La Metá involves him "gathering" food. Could you describe how that translates to the movement?**

**D:** Yes. In the dance, when Changó performs the A La Metá step, he mimics grinding flour and tasting it—it's a gesture showing the preparation of food. The movement with the tongue, which is sometimes mistaken as sensual, is actually him testing the warmth of the flour before serving it.

**I: Interesting! This movement has often been misinterpreted. What about the Aluya step? How is it different from A La Metá?**

**D:** The Aluya step also calls to Changó but in a different context. While A La Metá is more about gathering and feeding, Aluya has to do with the overarching spiritual call. In Yoruba, "aluya" literally means a summons. So, when dancers perform the Aluya step, they're engaging in a sacred ritual calling Changó and inviting his presence.

**I: It’s clear that these steps are more than just dance—they hold deep religious meaning. What happens in ceremonies when these steps are performed?**

**D:** When these steps are performed, especially with the three sacred batá drums—hita, oco, and añá—it creates a powerful connection between the dancer and the Orisha. The goal of such rituals is for the Orisha to possess the dancer and communicate with the audience. In the case of Changó, his energy, once summoned, can engage and interact with those present, providing a unique bridge between the spiritual and the physical world.

**I: That’s profound. How is this tradition viewed when taught or performed outside of Cuba, for example, in European dance schools?**

**D:** That’s a complex topic. Teaching these dances without the proper religious context can lead to a loss of their true meaning. In Europe, many instructors may focus solely on the artistic aspect without understanding or conveying the religious importance. This can sometimes lead to a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the culture. The true essence of these dances lies in their religious roots, and it's important that anyone teaching them knows the stories and respects their sacred origins.

**I: This has been incredibly insightful. Lastly, what would you say to dancers and teachers interested in learning and performing these Afro-Cuban steps?**

**D:** I’d say respect the culture. Understand that these dances are not just movements but stories and rituals passed down through generations. If you wish to learn and teach them, study the history, immerse yourself in the cultural context, and remember that these dances are about calling and embodying an Orisha, not just about the steps.

**I: Thank you for sharing your knowledge and passion. This interview truly sheds light on the deep cultural significance behind the Aluya and A La Metá steps.**

**D:** My pleasure. It’s important to keep these stories alive and shared with the right intent.
